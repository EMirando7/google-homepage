This is for self reflection purpose and to keep track of what I'm doing

1. Add the outline of the page (div,a with links). No css. Just pure HTML.
After adding the the about, store, gmail, images links, I couldn't figure out the little option squares on the top right that shows a collapsed view of Google's services. 
    !!TODO:
    The class of gb_C changes that square picture, if I change it, the image changes to a bell. // Still have to figure this out.  
2. Add the <img> for the profile picture with an <a> parent but it filled up the whole browser
    !!TODO: 
    Use CSS to fit it into the div container
