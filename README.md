This is for self reflection purpose and to keep track of what I'm doing

### HTML PORTION

1. Add the outline of the page (div,a with links). No css. Just pure HTML.
After adding the the about, store, gmail, images links, I couldn't figure out the little option squares on the top right that shows a collapsed view of Google's services. 
    !!TODO:
    The class of gb_C changes that square picture, if I change it, the image changes to a bell. // Still have to figure this out.  
2. Add the <img> for the profile picture with an <a> parent but it filled up the whole browser
    !!TODO: 
    Use CSS to fit it into the div container
3. The loop in the middle in the search bar is uses a picture as a svg file
    !!TODO:
    Figure out how to add the loop pic
4. Add the search bar and a class 
    !!TODO: 
    Add border, margin, padding 
5. Add a div below the search bar that with two buttons
6. Add two bottom divs with anchor tags

### CSS Curiosities
* `.left-side { position: absolute}`
    Made the left side to align with the right side, note that `.right-side` wasn't positioned. 
* Changing the padding-right of `profile-pic` changed its circular size
